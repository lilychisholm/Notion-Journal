# Notion-Journal
I made a little journal for Notion! Not complete yet, I want to add more customizability and make it so that things are saved longer using localStorage. Maybe I'll add even more features, we'll see!

## How do I use this?
Overall it's pretty simple! 

### What do I download?
Just download the file with all of the code, "Lavindex-Notion-Journal-App". Don't worry about all of the other pages. 
### How do I set it up?
Just click the "+" button beside a new component in Notion, and then scroll until you see something that says, "Embed". Just click that, and then you can click "Upload", then "Choose a File." Pick the file "Lavindex-Notion-Journal-App.html." The journal should then appear! It might take a few seconds to upload. You can size it however you like (thought you might have to fiddle around with its placement and columns in Notion and such in order to get it to look exactly how you want).

### How do I use it?
This is pretty straightforward. Next = next page. Previous = previous page. Everytime you make an entry, you MUST click "Save Entry," as there is no auto-save available at the moment (working on it!!). Add page lets you add a page wherever you like. Next page will add a page if you click next at the last page in the journal. The delete button deletes both pages you are on. The table of contents button hasn't been built yet (my bad) but it'll be there soon.

### Bugs and Upcoming Updates: 
I'm going to make this customizable so that you can change the colors! I also want to make it able to be saved, since currently it's using static storage :( 
Aside from that, I also want to add some stuff like page flipping, and a cover that can be used. I'm also going to add the table of contents as mentioned earlier.
